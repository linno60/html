        <p>On this page you can set the base rates for any period, including specific days of the week and minimum and maximum length of stay limitations. Base rates are also sometimes referred to as the BAR or "Best Available Rate". 
           <br><strong>Important:</strong> base rate is valid for all channels (manual reservations in the system, online booking page and connected OTAs.). Some OTAs do not allow setting minimum and maximum length of stay limitations, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudbeds.com/channel-settings/" class="underline-act">click here for more details</a>.</p>
