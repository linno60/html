        <p>On this page you can create special rate plans and packages for discounted daily rates or to upsell other services as a package. Packages can be created for any period, including availability on specific days of the week and minimum and maximum length of stay limitations. 
           <br>Unless a promo code is set, all special rates and packages created will be shown in addition to your base rates. </p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Rate plans and packages are not shared or synced with any OTAs or distribution channels. They will only appear for manual reservations in the system and online reservations through your property's website and Facebook booking engines.</p>
